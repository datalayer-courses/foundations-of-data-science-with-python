    "In {doc}`Chapter 2<../02-first-stats/intro>` and {doc}`Chapter 3<../03-first-data/intro>`, we introduced our first statistical tests. In each of these chapters, the examples ended with a test that was designed to determine whether some observed effect was \"significant\" in the sense that it is unlikely to have occurred under some default condition. In {doc}`Chapter 3<../03-first-data/intro>`, we began to formalize this by defining this default condition as a *null hypothesis*. We then introduced null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) as a way to conduct a statistical test to determine if an observed result can simply be explained by randomness in the data and limitations in the sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides a deeper and more detailed discussion of NHST and different ways to conduct these tests using resampling. To better understand such tests and how they are applied in this book, I start with a discussion of the different types of studies and experiments that are usually encountered in statistics."
