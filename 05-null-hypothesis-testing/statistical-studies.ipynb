Because researchers can directly compare the effect of a novel treatment to the effect of the standard treatment without potential biases in which participant received which treatment, statistical significance in an RCT is usually believe to indicate a *causal relationship*. That is, if the novel treatment shows a statistically significant beneficial outcome, then the presumption is that the novel treatment *causes* the beneficial outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider some factor that we wish to evaluate using observational data. For instance: does smoking tobacco cause cancer? If we believe that smoking causes cancer, then we cannot ethically assign people to smoke or not smoke at random. Similarly, because many people will have a strong preference about smoking, a random assignment to smoke or not smoke is not likely to be maintained. Instead, we must rely on observational studies. Using observational data,  we can only determine whether cancer and smoking are associated; we cannot directly infer that smoking tobacco causes cancer. Any observed association may be attributable to:\n",
    "* People who have cancer are more likely to smoke, for instance, to relieve pain.\n",
    "* There may be some other factor, such as genetics, that predispose people to both cancer and the desire to smoke. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember from {doc}`Chapter3<../03-first-data/hypothesis-testing>` that the null hypothesis was first proposed by Ronald A Fisher? Fisher was an avid smoker and argued that the strongly observed association between smoking cigarettes and cancer could be explained by other factors than smoking causing cancer. (See, for instance, his 1957 letter to the *British Medical Journal*, [\"Alleged Dangers of Cigarette-Smoking\"](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/fisher269.pdf). )\n",

    "Occasionally, circumstances result in a situation in which a particular treatment is applied to a portion of a population in such a way that the result can be treated as if it were applied to a random subset of the participants. For instance, from the 1970s to 1990s, twelve states had their entire prison population under court control because of litigation that alleged overcrowding. The effect of this court control was that the prison population grew more slowly than in other states. Most of these states had nearby states with similar demographics that were not affected by such a court order. Thus, the court orders controlling prison population growth created a *natural experiment*:\n",
